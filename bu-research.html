                    <strong>I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering</strong> from <a href="http://www.bu.edu/bme/">Boston University</a> in 2011. I studied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanotransduction">mechanotransduction</a>, the process by which physical forces are translated into biochemical signals within mammalian cells. In particular, I found (and find) fascinating the fact that cells mount diverse responses to not just biochemical but also physical inputs from the environment. I explored this question in the context of atherosclerosis, a disease of the blood vessel wall that is characterized by mechanical and molecular changes of the extracellular matrix. Understanding how these changes affect blood vessel tissue is key to creating better drugs to treat and prevent disease.

                    I was jointly advised by <a href="http://people.bu.edu/wonglab/">Joyce Wong</a> and <a href="http://www.uml.edu/Sciences/biology/faculty/Nugent-Matthew.aspx">Matthew Nugent</a> and benefited from a diverse community of biochemists, engineers, and cell biologists as mentors and fellow students. Toward the latter half of graduate school, I found myself gravitating more and more towards questions that could be answered through computational means. I wrote several MATLAB programs to:
                   
                        <ul>
                        <li><a href="images/live-confluence.pdf">measure percent confluence </a>(or cellular density) in a live cell culture from bright field microscopy images</li>
                        <li>quantify the morphology of <a href="images/protein-clusters.pdf">fluorescent protein clusters</a> in mammalian cells from confocal microscopy images</li>
                        <li><a href="AFM-roughness.html">quantify surface roughness</a> of biomaterials from AFM (atomic force microscopy) images</li>
                        </ul>
